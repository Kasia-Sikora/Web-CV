    <p><strong>Hello, I'm Kasia</strong><br>
      I am Java fullstack wannabe :) <br>
      My programming adventure started a
      year ago. Currently, I mainly develop
      my skills in Java 11, Spring and
      Angular. I also have some experience
      in Python, Flask, JavaScript and
      PostgreSQL. I am open to learn new
      technologies.</p>

    <p><strong>Interests</strong><br>
      In my free time I’m interested in pastries, from cakes and cookies to various kinds of bread. In
      addition, I’m interested in animal psychology, mainly dogs, and their training. Once in a while
      climbing gives me a bit of active recreation.</p>
