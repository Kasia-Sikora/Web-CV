<h4>Description:</h4>
<div class="line"></div>
<p>Project was generated with Angular CLI version 9.1.7.</p>
<p>The project was created in order to deepen knowledge in CSS and HTML.</p>
<p>The main assumption was to create a CV page that would contain all the necessary information about me. I think this
  is a more convenient and enjoyable way to view a resume than raw PDF.</p>
