<p>The player controls the "Vaus", a space vessel that acts as the game's "paddle" which prevents a ball from
  falling
  from the playing field, and attempts to bounce the ball against a number of bricks. The ball striking a brick
  causes the brick to disappear.

  It's a simple arcade game mostly built to practice javaScript.</p>
