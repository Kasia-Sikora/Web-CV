<h21> CV </h1>

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

The project was created in order to deepen knowledge in CSS and HTML.
The main assumption was to create a CV page that would contain all the necessary information about me. I think this is a more convenient and more enjoyable way to view a resume than raw PDF.

The website can be viewed here: [Curriculum Vitae](https://sikorakatarzyna.pl)
